A very simple dynamic UX/UI framework using Web Components, CSS custom properties and import maps.

This is intended as an intermediary layer between your content and a self contained component and or application without requiring an application framework to load first or at all. This useful for content websites that may only need a handful of
widgets and the option of adding an application. This is not an application framework nor does it facilitate in the construction of Single Page Apps (SPA).
