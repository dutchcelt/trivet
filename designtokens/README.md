# Default Trivet tokens

**NOTE**: TOKEN NAMING UNDER REVIEW

Trivet utilises the popular [Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary) approach to tokens. These also reasonably to the effort to have a W3C recommendation for this.

## The foundation of six

Tokens are set up in six foundational areas

1. Color
2. Layout
3. Spacing
4. Stroke
5. Toggles
6. Typography

### Color

The color tokens contain a basic color library based on the the [open source color pallet](https://yeun.github.io/open-color/).

Colours in Trivet are based on a set of contexts:

1. editorial
2. presentational
3. actionable
4. hierarchical
5. status

#### Token structure

1. scope
2. foundation
3. context
4. type (TODO: set boundary. May not be necessary.)
5. termination (state/range)
